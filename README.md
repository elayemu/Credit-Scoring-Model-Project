"""# Credit Scoring Model Project

## Overview
This project develops a Credit Scoring Model for Bati Bank to predict credit risk and provide real-time predictions. The project includes:

1. Understanding credit risk (Task 1).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Task 2).
3. Feature Engineering (Task 3).
4. Model training and evaluation (Task 4).
5. Model Serving API (Task 5).

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains datasets used in the project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter/Colab notebooks for tasks.
- `models/`: Trained ML models.
- `src/`: Python modules for feature engineering, modeling, and utilities.
- `api/`: Code for the REST API implementation.
- `reports/`: Interim and final reports.
- `docs/`: Additional documentation, including a blog post.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/credit-scoring-model.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run notebooks for analysis and modeling.
4. Deploy the API for real-time predictions.
